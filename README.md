### üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Code challenges
- Learning how to use GraphQl with Apollo Client. 
- Build a frontend app without having desings. 


### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Technologies 
#### Client:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.

- [Apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/): Apollo is a platform for building a supergraph, a unified network of all your data, services, and capabilities that connects to your application clients (such as web and native apps). At the heart of the supergraph is a query language called GraphQL.

- [Sass/Scss](http://sass-lang.com/): Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.

- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/): Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems.

- [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames): A simple JavaScript utility for conditionally joining classNames together.

#### Server
- [nodemon](https://yarnpkg.com/package/nodemon): nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid): Universally Unique Identifier. Used to generate id to Articles. 


### üìÅ Folder structure
```sh
src/
|‚Äì components/  # app ui components
|‚Äì context/ 
|  |‚Äì articles/ # graphQL Articles querys, Articles context
|‚Äì spec/        # UT mock data, function helpers
|‚Äì static/     
|   |‚Äì images/  # svg, png files.
```

### üí• Future improvements

- Github actions to automatically run Eslint and UT
#### Server: 
- Add UT
- Connect to a db like prisma or MongoDB

#### Client
- Add a burguer menu to show/hide the Articles list on small screens. 
- Add more UT
- Display unread articles first.
- Add dark theme. 
- Add src/css folder and split utils.scss with mixins, colors, animations, etc
- Better error handling of server requests. Example: Add a custom hook with a stwich case of the possible errors.
